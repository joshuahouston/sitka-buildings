# sitka-buildings
Process for importing Sitka area buildings and addresses to OpenStreetMap with height information

Building footprints were drawn from 2012 imagery publicly available [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AivzwD37VmVuh1L_9QZaFoqecfXX)

Heights were extracted using the footprint polygon's centroids and a point sampling tool to find the difference between the highest hit and the bare earth DEMs. These DEMs are in the public domain and if you would like a copy please contact [joshua.houston@cityofsitka.org](mailto:joshua.houston@cityofsitka.org)
